üéì Student Rating Dataset Analysis
üß≠ Objective
The aim of this practical is to analyze a Student Rating Dataset using Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib. The task includes performing statistical analysis, data visualization, and interpretation of various factors influencing teaching evaluations ‚Äî including tenure status, age, gender, and minority representation.

üìä Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about university professors and their student evaluation ratings. Each record represents one professor along with demographic and professional details.

Column	Description
ID	Unique identifier for each professor.
Tenure	Tenure status of the professor (Tenured or Untenured).
VisibleMinority	Indicates whether the professor belongs to a visible minority group (Yes/No).
Age	Age of the professor in years.
Gender	Gender of the professor (Male/Female).
EvaluationScore	Evaluation score given by students (on a 1‚Äì5 scale).

üß∞ Tools & Libraries Used
Tool/Library	Purpose
Python (v3.x)	Core programming language for analysis.
pandas	Data loading, cleaning, and manipulation.
NumPy	Numerical computations and descriptive statistics.
Matplotlib (Pyplot)	Visualization of data distributions and categorical variables.
Jupyter Notebook	Interactive environment for coding and visualization.

üßæ Results Summary
The percentage of visible minorities with tenure was 65.6%, while for non-minority faculty, it was 61.8%. This suggests no significant difference in tenure status based on minority representation in this dataset.

Tenured professors had a slightly higher average age of 52.3 years compared to untenured professors at 51.4 years.

Histograms were used to effectively display the age distribution, revealing the spread and central tendency of the professors' ages.

Bar charts were used to illustrate the gender ratio of professors.

The median evaluation score for tenured professors was computed to be 3.25.

üèÅ Conclusion
This practical provided valuable insights into data analysis and visualization using Python. It demonstrated how demographic and professional variables such as age, tenure, and minority status can be analyzed to uncover relationships within a dataset.

Through this exercise, I gained experience in:

Data generation and manipulation.

Descriptive statistical analysis.

Graphical representation and interpretation of data.

Overall, the practical strengthened my understanding of how to use Python‚Äôs data analysis ecosystem for exploring educational datasets and drawing meaningful conclusions.
