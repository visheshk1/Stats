# 🎓 Teachers Rating Dataset Analysis

## 🧭 Objective
The objective of this analysis is to explore a dataset of university instructors’ teaching evaluations using Python libraries such as *NumPy, **pandas, and **SciPy*.  
The goal is to perform statistical tests, evaluate relationships among variables, and interpret whether characteristics such as *gender, **tenure, and **beauty scores* influence teaching evaluation outcomes.

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about university instructors and their teaching evaluation ratings.  
It includes the following variables:

- *Professor Name:* Instructor’s name (may appear multiple times for different courses)  
- *Gender:* Male or Female  
- *Tenure:* Indicates whether the professor is tenured (Yes/No)  
- *Beauty:* Attractiveness score of the instructor  
- *Evaluation:* Teaching evaluation score (scale of 1–5)  
- *Students:* Number of students in the class (contains one large outlier)  
- *Age:* Instructor’s age  
- *Division:* Type of course — “Lower” or “Upper” division

## 🧪 Statistical Tests & Results

### 1️⃣ Gender and Evaluation (Independent T-Test)
*T-statistic:* -1.4065  
*P-value:* 0.1622  

This negative value indicates that the average Evaluation score for *male professors* is slightly lower than that for *female professors*.  
However, the difference is small and not practically meaningful.  

Since the p-value is *greater than 0.05, the result is **not statistically significant*.  
We therefore *fail to reject the null hypothesis, indicating that there is **no significant difference* in the mean evaluation scores between male and female professors.

---

### 2️⃣ Tenure and Evaluation (Independent T-Test)
*T-statistic:* -0.1541  
*P-value:* 0.8778  

This negative value indicates that the average Evaluation score for *tenured professors* is slightly lower than that of *non-tenured professors*.  
However, the difference in means is very small and not practically meaningful.  

Since the p-value is *greater than 0.05, the result is **not statistically significant*.  
Therefore, we *fail to reject the null hypothesis, indicating that **tenure status does not have a significant effect* on teaching evaluation scores.

---

### 3️⃣ Correlation Between Beauty and Evaluation
*Correlation Coefficient:* -0.0163  
*P-value:* 0.8602  

This value indicates a *very weak negative linear relationship* between Beauty and Evaluation.  
In practical terms, as a professor’s beauty score increases, their evaluation score tends to *slightly decrease*, but the effect is negligible.  

Since the p-value is *greater than 0.05, this correlation is **not statistically significant*.  
We therefore *fail to reject the null hypothesis*, suggesting that any relationship observed in the sample is likely due to random variation.

---

## 🧩 Conclusion
All statistical tests indicate that there are *no significant relationships* among the variables studied.  
Gender and tenure do not meaningfully affect evaluation scores, and beauty has no significant correlation with teaching evaluations.  

These findings suggest that, within this dataset, *appearance, gender, and tenure* do *not* substantially influence how professors are evaluated by students.  
Any minor differences in averages are likely due to chance rather than genuine underlying effects.

---

## 📚 Summary
- Gender → ❌ No significant effect on evaluations  
- Tenure → ❌ No significant effect on evaluations  
- Beauty → ❌ No significant correlation with evaluations  

Overall, *teaching evaluations appear independent of personal characteristics* such as gender, tenure status, or beauty score.
