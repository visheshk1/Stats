üéì Teachers' Rating Dataset Analysis
üß≠ Objective
The aim of this practical is to perform probability and hypothesis testing using the Teachers‚Äô Rating Dataset. The practical focuses on calculating probabilities of evaluation scores and conducting a two-tailed hypothesis test based on a normal distribution. Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and SciPy were used to perform the computations.

üìä Dataset Description
The dataset named ratings.csv contains information about university professors and their corresponding teaching evaluation ratings. It includes demographic details and professional attributes related to the instructors.

Column	Description
prof	A unique identifier for each professor.
age	Age of the professor in years.
gender	Gender of the professor (male/female).
minority	Indicates if the professor belongs to a visible minority group (yes/no).
tenure	Indicates whether the professor is tenured (yes) or untenured (no).
eval	Teaching evaluation score given by students (on a 1‚Äì5 scale).
students	Number of students who participated in the evaluation.
beauty	Numerical score representing the perceived physical appearance of the professor.
division	Indicates whether the course taught was a lower-division or upper-division course.

üßæ Results Summary
The analysis focused on the eval column, which represents the teaching evaluation scores.

Population Statistics: The entire dataset of evaluation scores has a mean (Œº) of 3.99 and a standard deviation (œÉ) of 0.55.

Probability Calculations:

The probability of a professor receiving an evaluation score greater than 4.5 is approximately 18.2%.

The probability of a score falling between 3.5 and 4.2 is approximately 62.5%.

Hypothesis Testing:

A two-tailed z-test was conducted on a random sample of 30 scores to determine if its mean was significantly different from the population mean.

The test resulted in a z-statistic of -0.82 and a p-value of 0.41.

Since the p-value (0.41) is greater than the significance level (Œ± = 0.05), the null hypothesis was not rejected. This indicates that there is not enough evidence to conclude that the sample mean is different from the population mean.

üèÅ Conclusion
This practical demonstrated how probability concepts and hypothesis testing can be applied to real datasets using Python. Through this task, I learned how to:

Compute probabilities from a dataset's distribution.

Conduct a two-tailed hypothesis test using a z-test.

Interpret statistical results, such as p-values, in the context of real-world performance evaluation.
