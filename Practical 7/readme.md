🎓 Teachers Rating Dataset Analysis
🧭 Objective
The aim of this practical is to explore relationships and differences within the Teachers’ Rating Dataset using regression analysis, ANOVA, and correlation tests.
These experiments help determine how factors such as gender, beauty, and age influence teaching evaluation scores and perceptions. Statistical methods are implemented using Python and the statsmodels library for meaningful interpretation.
📊 Dataset Description
The dataset (teachers_rating_data (4).csv) contains data about university professors and their corresponding teaching evaluation ratings. It includes demographic and professional details of instructors.
Column	Description
prof	Professor’s unique identifier
Gender	Gender of the professor (Male/Female)
Age	Age of the professor in years
Tenure	Indicates whether the professor is tenured (Yes/No)
Evaluation	Teaching evaluation score given by students
Students	Number of students who rated the professor
Beauty	Numerical score representing the perceived beauty of the professor
CourseLevel	Course type — lower or upper division
🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
Tool/Library	Purpose
Python (v3.x)	Programming environment
pandas	Data manipulation and preprocessing
statsmodels	Regression, T-test, and ANOVA analysis
scipy	Statistical hypothesis testing
Google Colab	Code execution and visualization environment
🧾 Results Summary
Statistical analyses were performed to answer three key questions, using a significance level of p < 0.05.
1.	Gender & Evaluation (Regression T-test)
o	Question: Does gender affect teaching evaluation rates?
o	Result: No. There is no statistically significant difference in teaching evaluation ratings between male and female instructors (p = 0.388).
2.	Age & Beauty (ANOVA)
o	Question: Does the beauty score for instructors differ by age group?
o	Result: No. The ANOVA test found that instructors’ beauty scores do not significantly differ across age groups (20s, 30s, 40s, 50s) (F(4,116) = 1.03, p = 0.378).
3.	Beauty & Evaluation (Correlation / Regression)
o	Question: Is teaching evaluation score correlated with beauty score?
o	Result: No. Beauty score was not a significant predictor of teaching evaluations (p = 0.295). This indicates that, in this dataset, instructors’ beauty scores have no meaningful statistical impact on their evaluation ratings.
🏁 Conclusion
This practical provided hands-on experience in:
•	Applying OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) regression to interpret coefficients.
•	Conducting T-tests and ANOVA for hypothesis testing between groups.
•	Exploring correlation (via regression) between continuous variables.
The exercise improved understanding of data-driven hypothesis testing and inferential statistics. Based on this specific dataset, demographic factors like gender, age, and beauty did not show a statistically significant influence on teaching evaluations.
